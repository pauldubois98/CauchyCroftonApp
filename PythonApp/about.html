        <h1>Frame of the prject</h1>

	<h2>Context</h2>	
	<p>This project has been made for the 2nd year math course of UCL.</p>

	<h2>Aim</h2>
It is a dicreate application of the Cauchy-Crofton Formulae that we demonstrated (file <a href="../Cauchy-Crofton_Formula.pdf">here</a>)<br>
The goal is to illustarate the theorem with a graphical image.</p>

	<h2>Use</h2>
	<p>This theorem can be used for calculation the lenght of any regular curve (in particular complicated ones, that aren't just arcs and straight lines)<br>
This method is used to calculate the lenght of DNA, for example.</p>
