      <h1>The Cauchy-Crofton App</h1>
      <h2>by Paul Dubois</h2>
      <p>
          This app was made as an addition of a small research project during my 2nd year project in UCL as a math undergraduate student.<br>
          This project was made by Aadil Khan, Caroline Bouat, Chris Bishop, and myself.<br>
          The paper we made at the end of the project is avaible in PDF version throught the app (as "Mathematical Paper").
