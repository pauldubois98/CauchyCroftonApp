      <h1>The Cauchy-Crofton Formulae</h1>
      <p>
          The Cauchy Crofton Formulae describe a way to calculate the lenght of a curve (of any type, it doesn't need to be regular, nor close or continuous). To do so, me need to measure the intersections of the curve with the (infinite) set of all straight lines.<br>
          Of course, in reality, this can not be done. But we can still try to approximate the lenght of the curve with a few lines. It turns out that this approximations works quite well. This is especially useful for nasty curves, that we don't have formulae to systematically calulate the lenght.</p>

          Exemple:<br>
          Calculating the lenght of a circle with this method isn't very smart as we know it will be 2*pi*r (with r the radius of the circle).<br>
          Never the less, this may be perfect of estimating the length of your matted USB cables :)

          This app enables you to select a picture of a curve, and estimate it's length with the Cauchy-Crofton Formulae.
